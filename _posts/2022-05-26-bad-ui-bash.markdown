Last week, I cohosted an M&T Tech Coding Challenge called the Bad UI Bash. The general task was to make the worst user interface imaginable for the applying to a job and submitting a resume. Here are excerpts of some of the "copywriting" I did to promote the event:

> The world is full of bad user experiences... These poor outcomes come mostly from a lack of understanding of good UI;
> however, they also come from a lack of understanding about bad UI.

> By intentionally developing bad experiences, we are forced to engage deeply with the user’s expectations and our interface’s accessibility (or lack thereof).
> Your challenge is to design the worst possible experience, but the skills you develop along the way will be useful in developing excellent experiences as well.

Overall, I believe that the event was a huge success. Truckloads of talent were on full display, and many laughs were shared. All of the submissions are available on [Github](https://github.com/M-T-TDP-BadUIBash), and  here are the winners: [1st](https://github.com/M-T-TDP-BadUIBash/david-baduibash-2022)  [2nd](https://github.com/M-T-TDP-BadUIBash/rileyb123.github.io) [3rd](https://github.com/M-T-TDP-BadUIBash/Maddie-BadUIBash)

Sadly, as one of the two cohosts, I was unable to participate. However, I did help in designing and promoting the challenge, running the individual kick-off and showcase events, and setting up the submission process.

Actually, the most technically involved part of the experience was handling the submissions. I had to learn about the intricacies of Github organizations and templates, only to have my efforts rendered moot by participants forking the template instead of clicking the "Use as Template" button! This prevented them from forking their project repositories into the organization, our chosen submission method. Now I know for the future that I will have to take the ridiculous measures of altering the entire organization's settings to make the template repository unforkable, but only temporarily, since if it is permanently unforkable then the repositories that results from using the template are also unable to be forked, and they need to be forked in order to be submitted. I hope that this run-on sentence adequately expresses the sense of mania that this process engenders.

I am only half-joking. Truthfully, I'm grateful that I hitched my wagon to such a great cohost, and I'm eagerly awaiting the next challenge!
