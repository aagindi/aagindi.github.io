J'adoube (pronounced /ZHaˈdo͞ob/) is a French word frequently used by chess players meaning *I adjust*.

For me, this capacity for adjustment constitutes a sort of professional credo. When I write code, and I sense that I'm going down the wrong path, *j'adoube*. When a different technique has the potential to improve my work, *j'adoube*. When a new idea piques my interest, *j'adoube*.

### About This

This site will likely fail to clearly embody that ideal. My vision for this place is a showcase, an opportunity to display things after they're complete (enough) and perhaps even a bit polished. To better represent the philosophy *j'adoube* I would need to give impractically frequent, minutiae-laden reports - and who would want to read that?
