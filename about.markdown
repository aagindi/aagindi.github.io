J'adoube (pronounced /ZHaˈdo͞ob/) is a French word frequently used by chess players meaning *I adjust*.

## About *this*
In keeping with the spirit of *j'adoube*, the purpose of this place will be perpetually adjusting. Sometimes it will be a backdrop for my musings. Other times it can be a repository for maths and technical thoughts. 

## About *audience*
Should *you* read this? I'm not sure. This is really for me. The goal of this blog is to deliberately cultivate my own curiosity - I'm not trying to make things that anyone else will enjoy.

## About *me*
I'm Aaron. Hello.
